# screenshot-to-code

This is a simple app that converts a screenshot to HTML/Tailwind CSS. It uses GPT-4 Vision to generate the code, and DALL-E 3 to generate similar looking images.

## Updates

* Nov 16 - View code directly within the app
* Nov 15 - ðŸ”¥ You can now instruct the AI to update the code as you wish. Useful if the AI messed up some styles or missed a section.


## Getting Started

The app has a React/Vite frontend and a FastAPI backend. You will need an OpenAI API key with access to the GPT-4 Vision API.

Run the backend (make sure you have poetry installed on your system):

```bash
cd backend
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key" > .env
poetry install
poetry shell
poetry run uvicorn main:app --reload --port 7000
```

Run the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
yarn
yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 to use the app.

If you prefer to run the backend on a different port, update VITE_WS_BACKEND_URL in `frontend/.env.local`
