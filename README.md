# screenshot-to-code

This is a simple app that converts a screenshot to HTML/Tailwind CSS. It uses GPT-4 Vision to generate the code, and DALL-E 3 to generate similar looking images.

## Updates

* Nov 16 - Added a setting to disable DALL-E image generation if you don't need that
* Nov 16 - View code directly within the app
* Nov 15 - ðŸ”¥ You can now instruct the AI to update the code as you wish. Useful if the AI messed up some styles or missed a section.


## Getting Started

The app has a React/Vite frontend and a FastAPI backend. You will need an OpenAI API key with access to the GPT-4 Vision API.

Run the backend (I use Poetry for package management - `pip install poetry` if you don't have it):

```bash
cd backend
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key" > .env
poetry install
poetry shell
poetry run uvicorn main:app --reload --port 7000
```

Run the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
yarn
yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 to use the app.

If you prefer to run the backend on a different port, update VITE_WS_BACKEND_URL in `frontend/.env.local`

## FAQs

* **I'm running into an error when setting up the backend. How can I fix it?** [Try this](https://github.com/abi/screenshot-to-code/issues/3#issuecomment-1814777959). If that still doesn't work, open an issue.
* **How do I get an OpenAI API key that has the GPT4 Vision model available?** Create an OpenAI account. And then, you need to buy at least $1 worth of credit on the [Billing dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview).
* **How can I provide feedback?** For feedback, feature requests and bug reports, open an issue or ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_abi_).
